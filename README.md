This project explores child longitudinal study data that outlines data points on fall/spring reading, math, and general knowledge scores of individual students by income. The data shows the scores for fall 1998 and spring 1999 measurements, evaluating kindergarten students over the span of several months. The analysis is guided by the following questions:

Research question 1: Does income group significantly predict differences in spring general knowledge scores among kindergarten students after controlling baseline reading and math abilities?
To answer the research question on whether the income group significantly predicts differences in spring general knowledge scores among kindergarten students after controlling baseline reading and math abilities the one-way ANCOVA has been employed. 



Research question 2: Does income group predict spring math scores while controlling for baseline fall math scores?
The one-way ANCOVA has been conducted to respond to the research question whether the income group predicts spring math scores while controlling for baseline fall math scores.
